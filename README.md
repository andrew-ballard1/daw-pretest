### Some notes before diving into the repo
This project is borne from a template I use for freelance gigs - it's an ejected create-react-app project from quite a while ago. As such, you're going to see a lot of BS in here - stuff that's usually not surfaced when using the now deprecated `create-react-app`.

You might also find some easter eggs, like a picture of me with a **kick-ass Tron themed mullet** and a really boring plain text resume.

### At some point in the near future, there will be more things here
